# Sloan-Digital-Sky

This project used supervised learning techniques such as Multinomial Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classification, on the unsupervised learning space we used K means and Heairarchal Clustering. The goal was to distinguish Stars, Quasars and Galaxies which the supervised method did a good job in without overfitting, the dimensions were reduced using the Principal Component Analysis.
